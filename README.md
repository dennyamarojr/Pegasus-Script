# Pegasus-Script
This is the Pegasus Script from a creation from multiple debloat scripts and gists from github. It's a powershell script for automation of routine tasks done after fresh installations of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 / 2019. Also is settings which I like to use and which in my opinion make the system lightest possible.
